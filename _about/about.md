<hr/>
I am an incoming Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Austin College, Sherman, Texas, USA. I completed my Ph.D.  from  Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of North Texas, working under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Saraju P Mohanty](https://www.smohanty.org/), my specialization involves <b>Internet-of-Things (IoT) Applications, Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Collaborative Edge Computing, Cybersecurity, Secure Authentication.</b><br>

I obtained my Master of Technology degree in Signal Processing and VLSI from Jain University, Bangalore, India in 2012. I completed my Master of Science degree in Electrical Systems in the Department of Engineering Technology, University of North Texas, Denton Texas, in 2014. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering degree from Golden Valley Institute of Technology, K.G.F, India in 2000. I have worked as a Lecturer at Kuppam Engineering College, Andhra Pradesh, India for a term of 2 years. In the USA, I have worked as a Software Developer for HMSA (Blue Cross Blue Shield of Hawaii), Honolulu, Hawaii for a period of 2 years.



I am a passionate researcher in the field of security-aware Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cybersecurity. My research involves Secure Authentication systems for Edge Data Centers in Collaborative Edge Computing environments with an emphasis on reliability. The goal of my research is to model a secure, reliable, and energy-aware authentication system to provide security for the cyberphysical systems in a resource-constrained smart village ecosystem. Developing hardware-assisted security solutions incorporating Security-by-Design(SbD) principles, using Physically Unclonable Functions (PUF), Certificate Authority (CA), and integrating Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence models in the security systems for secure authentication and monitoring of Edge Devices, improving the reliability, reducing latency, computation overhead, area overhead and power consumption.
